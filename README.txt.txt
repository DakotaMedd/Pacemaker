This is an alternate distribution of the sirwolfgang\Pacemaker project, which was authored by SirWolfgang, DakotaMedd, GJBianco. Has a simplier interface, but the game is in 2D.
To play, just download and run. When you reach the end, the game will restart. Just close out and open again to generate a new session.
